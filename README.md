# Video Game Sales Data
DATA 115 Personal Dataset Project for Spring 2021

## Motivation
When I was around six-years-old I was introduced to my very first video game by my older brother which happened to be Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal on the PlayStation 2. Ever since that moment of playing my first video game on my first video game platform, I have been infatuated with various types of games on various platforms. Something that captivated me with video games was the diversity and the different types of platforms that I could play video games on. This infatuation had me producing questions regarding video games such as what is the most popular game of all time, what is the most popular video game platform of all time, and what is the most popular video game genre of all time. Since I couldn't find any metrics for video game ratings and I'm a business student, I figured total sales volume would be a great metric to measure in terms of popularity. After figuring out my research focus I investigated my questions and assumptions.

## Data Source
The data was obtained through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales">Kaggle</a> which was generated by a scrape of <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/">VGChartz</a>. The dataset contains the following fields: rank, name, platform, year, genre, publisher, NA sales, EU sales, JP sales, other sales, and Global sales. The dataset contains a total of 16,598 records that only consist of video games with sales that are greater than 100,000 copies.

## Visualizations
The first visualization displays the top 10 ranking games according to global sales. The second visualization displays the global sales for video games according to each video game platform. The third visualization displays the global sales for video games according to their genre.
